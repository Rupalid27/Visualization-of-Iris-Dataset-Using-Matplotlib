# Visualization-of-Iris-Dataset-Using-Matplotlib                  
The Iris dataset contains three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.  
   
**Key Visualizations Included:**                     
                   
**Scatter Plots:** Creating scatter plots to visualize the relationships between pairs of features (e.g., sepal length vs. sepal width, petal length vs. petal width) for each Iris species. The plots offer insights into the potential separability of species based on these attributes.                                  
**Bar Graph:** used a bar graph to illustrate the distribution of the three Iris species. Each bar represents the count of data points belonging to each species, offering a clear comparison of their occurrences.                                  
**Pie Chart:** The pie chart showcases the proportions of each Iris species in the dataset. It presents a visual representation of the relative size of each species within the whole dataset.                                        
**Box Plot:** I employed a box plot to visualize the distribution of petal length for each Iris species. The plot displays the quartiles, median, and potential outliers, allowing a quick comparison of the petal length distribution among the species.                                 
**Subplot:** Subplots were used to create side-by-side visualizations, such as scatter plots for various attribute pairs (e.g., sepal length vs. sepal width, petal length vs. petal width) for each Iris species. This layout enables easy comparison and identification of relationships between attributes.                                        
**Line Chart:** The line chart illustrates the trend of sepal length for each Iris species across a range of data points. It helps in understanding the change in sepal length over a continuous variable, such as time or index.
